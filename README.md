## Overview
Simple challenge to recreate a card from a screenshot. Used very simple, but semantic HTML and CSS with variables and nesting which was introduced very lately into CSS Standards.

This project is not deployed. Clone it to see the result.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox

### What I learned
Nothing really new. I've used CSS Nesting first time since it is oficially available. Anything big, but **it's something**, isn't it?
